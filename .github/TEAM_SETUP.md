# Team Development Guide

## ðŸš€ Required Setup for Team Members

Each team member needs these secrets configured in their fork or the main repo needs shared secrets:

```
FIREBASE_ANDROID_APP_ID=1:YOUR_PROJECT_NUMBER:android:YOUR_APP_ID
FIREBASE_IOS_APP_ID=1:YOUR_PROJECT_NUMBER:ios:YOUR_APP_ID  
FIREBASE_CLI_TOKEN=YOUR_CLI_TOKEN
IOS_P12_BASE64=BASE64_ENCODED_CERTIFICATE
IOS_P12_PASSWORD=CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD
IOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE=BASE64_ENCODED_PROFILE
KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD=ANY_SECURE_PASSWORD
```

### 3. Firebase Project Access
- Must be added to Firebase project
- Contact admin for Firebase project access

### 4. iOS Development Setup
- Xcode installed with command line tools
- Apple Developer account configured in Xcode
- Device registered in Apple Developer portal (for testing)

## ðŸ”§ Testing the Workflow

### Before pushing code:
1. **Check Apple Developer access**: Can you see team 66VPE47DN4 in Xcode?
2. **Verify Firebase access**: Can you access the Firebase console?
3. **Test local iOS build**: Does `flutter build ipa --export-options-plist=ios/ExportOptions.plist` work?

### If workflow fails:
1. **Check secrets**: Are all GitHub secrets properly configured?
2. **Verify certificates**: Are your certificates valid and not expired?
3. **Check team membership**: Are you part of the Apple Developer team?
